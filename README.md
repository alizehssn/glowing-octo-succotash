# glowing-octo-succotash:The Work Day Schedular
In this assignment a dynamic schedule planner was deployed using javascript,jquery, and AJAX. In order to complete said task the moment.js function was utilized to pull the current date to the schedule planner. Cols and rows were created for the time of day and event. A for loop determined whether the event was in the past present or future and color coded accordingly. In addition these events and their time were saved to local storage.
